experiences:
    - role: Intern (Secondment) 
      time: May 2019 - Aug 2019 
      company: TNO, Helmond, the Netherlands
      details: | 
        In this secondment at the Integrated Vehicle Safety group at TNO, I was working on a control design to achieve platooning of vehicles with dynamics limitations.The design, grounded in model predictive control (MPC), employs a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy to achieve vehicle platooning.
    - role: Process Engineer
      time: 2015 - 2016
      company: Syncreon, Waalwijk, the Netherlands
      details: |
        As a process/automation engineer at Syncreon, I was working alongside our customers in the design and install of engineering solutions, while also working with our suppliers and managing the engineering project finances and planning. My primary responsibility lied in setup and maintenance of production lines, especially in installation, validation, documentation and support of robots and automated equipment.
    - role: System Engineer
      time: 2014 - 2015
      company: Applied Micro Electronics "AME" B.V., Eindhoven, the Netherlands
      details: |
        Working as a system engineer responsible for developing mechatronics systems for domestic applications. I was involved in the entire development of the mechatronics systems consisting of plastic casings, motors, springs, sensors, etc., from conceptual design, prototyping, testing to mass production. Working in a ODM (original design manufacturer) as AME, I have also practiced my communication skills with customers and suppliers.
    - role: Intern (Mater graduation project)
      time: Jan 2013 - Aug 2013
      company: Phiips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands
      details: |
        In this project, an approach is proposed to study structural identifiability of an ultrasonic transducer and a method is developed to estimate transducer parameters by using transducer impedances to provide information on transducer quality. First, an equivalent circuit model for an ultrasonic transducer is shown. Second, the Laplace transform approach is extended and applied to analyze the structural identifiability of an ultrasonic transducer system. Structural identifiability of transducer parameters is studied to provide a guideline for the choice of parameters to be estimated. Finally, a Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) method is developed to estimate the transducer parameters by fitting the simulated to the measured transducer impedances. The NLS method is applied to the parameter estimations of ultrasonic transducers with various parameters. The results show the robustness and accuracy of the method. In the project, MATLAB is extensively used for modeling, identifiability analysis and parameter estimation.

    - role: Intern (Internship)
      time: Aug 2013 - Dec 2013
      company: Phiips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands
      details: |
        Within Philips Research various ultrasonic transducers are integrated in minimally invasive devices. Although there exist guidelines in literature for transducer design, quality assessment is still indispensable due to unavoidable manufacture errors. Therefore, it is desired to develop a simple and reliable way to perform the quality assessment of an ultrasonic transducer based on its impedance which is easy to obtain. In this internship, a Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) method is developed to estimate transducer parameters by using transducer impedances to provide the information on transducer quality.
